# Basic Hardhat project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a smart contract that stores the information of people and their favorite number. I have defined some test for it and also there is gas-calculator added to it. tasks is performed to get the current block number on the chain.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
